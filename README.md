## Nextflow on AWS – Biotech Blueprint

This Quick Start deploys a genomics analysis environment on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud, using Nextflow to create and orchestrate analysis workflows and AWS Batch to run the workflow processes.

Nextflow is an open-source workflow framework and domain-specific language (DSL) for Linux, developed by the [Comparative Bioinformatics group](https://www.crg.eu/en/programmes-groups/notredame-lab) at the [Barcelona Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG)](https://www.crg.eu/). The tool enables you to create complex, data-intensive workflow pipeline scripts, and simplifies the implementation and deployment of genomics analysis workflows in the cloud.

This Quick Start is for teams or individuals who manage informatics infrastructure and genomics analysis for a biotech company.

The Quick Start deploys Nextflow into the infrastructure set up by the [Biotech Blueprint core Quick Start](https://fwd.aws/mnWqP). If you want to use an existing virtual private cloud (VPC) or create a new VPC, follow the [Genomics Workflows on AWS](https://docs.opendata.aws/genomics-workflows/orchestration/nextflow/nextflow-overview/) instructions instead. If you're new to AWS or don’t have a strong VPC architecture already, we recommend that you first use the Biotech Blueprint core Quick Start to set up the landing zone for future AWS usage. This environment is automatically configured for identity management, access control, encryption key management, network configuration, logging, alarms, partitioned environments, and built-in compliance auditing, to help meet your security and compliance requirements.
